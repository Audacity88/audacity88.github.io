# Pass notes

## Pass 1: Scaffold and content, 2026-10-29

Created a static Astro 7.4.4 site with TypeScript, plain CSS, all requested sections, and the ranked eight-project grid. Added editable project, experience, and upstream PR JSON files with build-time validation and a data editing guide. Added system-aware light and dark themes with a persistent toggle, responsive layouts, keyboard focus states, a skip link, and reduced-motion support. The resume link appears only when `public/resume.pdf` exists.

Kept the supplied project verification states, hid null demo links, labeled empty media slots, identified the video plugin as a credited MIT-licensed port, and kept client names behind approval placeholders. The merged-PR count remains internal with `display: false`; it never enters generated page content. Recorded the task's local-only and content rules in `AGENTS.md`.

Validation on `Mac-mini.local`, working directory `/Users/natalie/Development/portfolio`:

- `npm install --cache /private/tmp/dan-portfolio-npm-cache` passed, with zero reported vulnerabilities. The initial plain install could not write the existing user cache; no cache permissions were changed.
- `PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/ ASTRO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 npm run build` passed. Generated canonical and asset paths used the site root.
- Final `ASTRO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 npm run build` passed with zero errors, warnings, or hints. Static output is in `dist/`, configured for `/portfolio/`.
- Inspected generated markup for the default canonical, favicon, and CSS paths, project statuses, demo links, and hidden resume link. Found no client placeholder, private repository link, or merged-PR total in `dist/`. `git diff --check` passed.

Still pending: browser and phone visual review, interactive theme verification, individual project builds and demo flows, iOS device verification, genuine screenshots or video, an approved resume, and approved client details or additional experience facts. The portfolio build does not verify the projects. All changes remain local; nothing was committed, pushed, or deployed.
