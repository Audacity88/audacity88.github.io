# Pass notes

## Pass 1: Scaffold and content, 2026-10-29

Created a static Astro 7.4.4 site with TypeScript, plain CSS, all requested sections, and the ranked eight-project grid. Added editable project, experience, and upstream PR JSON files with build-time validation and a data editing guide. Added system-aware light and dark themes with a persistent toggle, responsive layouts, keyboard focus states, a skip link, and reduced-motion support. The resume link appears only when `public/resume.pdf` exists.

Kept the supplied project verification states, hid null demo links, labeled empty media slots, identified the video plugin as a credited MIT-licensed port, and kept client names behind approval placeholders. The merged-PR count remains internal with `display: false`; it never enters generated page content. Recorded the task's local-only and content rules in `AGENTS.md`.

Validation on `Mac-mini.local`, working directory `/Users/natalie/Development/portfolio`:

- `npm install --cache /private/tmp/dan-portfolio-npm-cache` passed, with zero reported vulnerabilities. The initial plain install could not write the existing user cache; no cache permissions were changed.
- `PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/ ASTRO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 npm run build` passed. Generated canonical and asset paths used the site root.
- Final `ASTRO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 npm run build` passed with zero errors, warnings, or hints. Static output is in `dist/`, configured for `/portfolio/`.
- Inspected generated markup for the default canonical, favicon, and CSS paths, project statuses, demo links, and hidden resume link. Found no client placeholder, private repository link, or merged-PR total in `dist/`. `git diff --check` passed.

Still pending: browser and phone visual review, interactive theme verification, individual project builds and demo flows, iOS device verification, genuine screenshots or video, an approved resume, and approved client details or additional experience facts. The portfolio build does not verify the projects. All changes remain local; nothing was committed, pushed, or deployed.

## Pass 2: Design polish, 2026-10-29

Added a warm light palette and an ink dark palette with cobalt/periwinkle accents, larger system typography, an italic serif accent, more space between sections, and coordinated abstract SVG illustrations. Polished featured project cards, technology chips, verification badges, buttons, link states, contact section, and footer. Kept mobile section navigation visible, with 44px-tall controls. Added brief entrance motion and hover transitions that respect reduced-motion preferences. No external fonts or new dependencies.

Re-read `facts.md` and reconciled every experience entry and rendered experience claim. Added `reviewStatus: needs-dan-ok`, the employer approval flag, and the client approval placeholder with its neutral `publicFallback`. Clarified demo/pilot and not-shipped wording, the team role on Flying Colors, and the solo role on Civics Time Machine. Added the approved prompt-cache comparison. Updated the data guide and recorded the required per-pass facts check in `AGENTS.md`. Preserved the project seeds, verification states, hidden null demo links, and hidden merged-PR count.

Validation on `Mac-mini.local`, working directory `/Users/natalie/Development/portfolio`:

- Final `ASTRO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 npm run build` passed with zero errors, warnings, or hints.
- Inspected static output for eight project cards and badges, unique IDs, working section-anchor targets, approval flags, and local stylesheet assets. No hidden PR total, client placeholder/name, or private links appeared in output.
- Executed the built theme scripts with a mocked DOM and storage. Checked auto/light/dark cycling, persisted choices on reload, invalid stored values, accessible button labels, and unavailable storage.
- Calculated text contrast for the main palette pairs. Minimum checked ratios were 5.02:1 in light mode and 6.49:1 in dark mode. This does not replace a browser accessibility audit.
- `git diff --check` passed. Static HTML, CSS, and favicon total about 38 KB uncompressed.

Browser visual and interactive review remains pending: computer-use access to Chrome was not approved. Responsive layout and reduced-motion behavior were checked in source only. Individual project builds, demo flows, iOS behavior, genuine media, and publication approvals remain pending. All changes are local; nothing was committed, pushed, or deployed.
